# User Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This update adds user tracking to all transaction records (Sales, Expenses, Payments, and Counter Readings) so that the system can display which user created each record instead of showing "System".

## Database Changes

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration
Execute the following SQL file in your database to add the `created_by` field to all relevant tables:

```bash
# File: database/add_created_by_field.sql
```

This will:
- Add `created_by` column to `sales`, `machine_expenses`, `machine_payments`, and `machine_counters` tables
- Create indexes for better query performance
- Link the `created_by` field to the `users` table

### Step 2: Verify the Changes
After running the migration, verify that the columns were added:

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name IN ('sales', 'machine_expenses', 'machine_payments', 'machine_counters')
  AND column_name = 'created_by';
```

## Code Changes

The following files have been updated:

1. **src/hooks/useSales.ts**
   - Fetches user data and maps it to sales records
   - Stores current user ID when creating new sales

2. **src/hooks/useMachineExpenses.ts**
   - Fetches user data and maps it to expense records
   - Stores current user ID when creating new expenses

3. **src/hooks/useMachinePayments.ts**
   - Fetches user data and maps it to payment records
   - Stores current user ID when creating new payments

4. **src/hooks/useMachineCounters.ts**
   - Fetches user data and maps it to counter reading records
   - Stores current user ID when creating new counter readings

5. **src/pages/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Updated to display the actual user name instead of "System"
   - Shows format: `(User Name, 6:40 PM 14 Oct 2025)`

## How It Works

1. When a user creates a new record (sale, expense, payment, or counter reading), the system:
   - Retrieves the current user's ID from localStorage
   - Stores it in the `created_by` field

2. When displaying records:
   - The system fetches user information along with the transaction data
   - Maps the `created_by` ID to the user's name
   - Displays the user's name in the transaction log

3. For existing records (created before this update):
   - Records without a `created_by` value will show "System"
   - New records will show the actual user's name

## Testing

After applying these changes:

1. Log in as a user (e.g., "Clowee Admin" or "Rafi")
2. Create a new transaction (sale, expense, payment, or counter reading)
3. Check the Dashboard's "Recent Transactions" section
4. Verify that the transaction shows your username instead of "System"

Example output:
- Before: `(System, 6:40 PM 14 Oct 2025)`
- After: `(Clowee Admin, 6:40 PM 14 Oct 2025)`

## Notes

- Existing records created before this update will continue to show "System" since they don't have a `created_by` value
- Only new records created after applying these changes will show the actual user name
- The system gracefully handles cases where user information is not available
